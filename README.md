1) get the users input
input:3
output:3
1.1) taking the users input and parseInt and store the value in a variable

2) Set our numerals array. 4 nested arrays inside the numerals array.

2.1) write a function to convert the numbers into roman numeral strings

3)create an empty string variable for numeral output

3.1create variable that takes the userinput number: converts it to individual string elements inside a new array and reverses it.

3.2)start loop that begins at 0 and increments by one for the length of the new userinput array.

3.3)create new variable equal to the position within the numerals array based on the iteration of the for loop

3.4)numeral equals the first declared position and the parsint of the romannumber based on the iteration

123 is taken as input
converts to ["3", "2", "1"]

array is 3 positions in length
[0][3] = "III"
[1][2] = "XX"
[2][1] = "C"

concatinat the numeral at that position to the empty variable numeral


It will return the letter I for the number 1.
If input = 1, then it will return I.

It will return III for the number 3.
